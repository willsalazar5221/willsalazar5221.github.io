### **YSO SED Fitting Analysis Pipeline** 
- [GitHub](https://github.com/willsalazar5221/YSO_Python_Pipeline)
- Python scripts creating data files integrating multi-survey photometry (2MASS, Spitzer, Gaia) for spectral energy distribution modeling of YSOs in the SPICY catalog using Tom Robitaille's 2017 sedfitter
- Additional parameter analysis from parameter files outputted by the SED fitting process
